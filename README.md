<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this project we will make a fighting game simalar to arcade Mortal Kombat.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>There will be six screens:</p>
<p>Main Menu</p>
<p>Map Selection</p>
<p>Main Game</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>Pause Screen</p>
<p>Results Screen</p>

<br>

<p>Info for characters:</p>
<p>There will be two to four character to choose from.</p>
<p>Each character will have two basic attack moves: light attack and heavy attack</p>
<p>Along with that you will be able to jump</p>
<p>Since we are working in 2d, the only movement the characters will have is left or right.</p>

<br>

<p>Info for the levels:</p>
<p>There will be two maps to choose from.</p>
<p>Maps will not have any dynamic movement, they will be static.</p>
<p>Maps will not be interactive.</p>
<p>Overall the maps will be for decorative purpose.</p>

<br>

<p>General things to think about:</p>
<p>We will have to setup a control scheme that will be intuative to the user and that won't be cluncky.</p>
<p>Think about the character models.</p>
